# Token Spawning System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated a token spawning system into the Kurve game that adds three new token-based superpowers alongside the existing key-activated superpowers.

## Token Types Implemented

### 1. Reverse Controls (Magenta #ff00ff)
- **Effect**: Inverts the player's left/right controls
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds (random)
- **Scope**: Only affects the player who collected the token

### 2. Player Wraparound (Cyan #00ffff)
- **Effect**: Allows the player to pass through walls and appear on the opposite side
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds (random)
- **Scope**: Only affects the player who collected the token
- **Visual**: Player head position wraps to opposite side when crossing borders

### 3. Global Wraparound (Yellow #ffff00)
- **Effect**: ALL players can pass through walls
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds (random)
- **Scope**: Affects all players when collected by any player
- **Visual**: Game border pulses yellow and increases in width

## Token Spawning

- **Frequency**: Tokens spawn every 5-15 seconds (randomized)
- **Location**: Random positions with 50px margin from borders
- **Appearance**: 12px radius circles with colored borders matching their effect
- **Collection**: Automatic when a curve's head touches the token

## Files Created

- `src/KurveTokenmanager.js` - Core token management system

## Files Modified

1. **src/KurveSuperpowerconfig.js**
   - Added three new superpower type constants
   - Added configurations for the new token-based superpowers

2. **src/KurveConfig.js**
   - Added Token configuration section with spawn intervals and effect durations

3. **src/KurveCurve.js**
   - Added `controlsReversed` and `wraparoundEnabled` state variables
   - Added `applyReverseControls()` and `applyWraparound()` methods
   - Modified `computeNewAngle()` to respect reversed controls
   - Modified `isCollided()` to handle wraparound logic
   - Added `handleWraparound()` method for border teleportation

4. **src/KurveGame.js**
   - Initialize TokenManager in `init()`
   - Update and check token collisions in `drawFrame()`
   - Draw tokens in the render pipeline
   - Reset tokens in `terminateRound()`
   - Redraw border when global wraparound is active

5. **src/KurveField.js**
   - Added `pixiTokens` graphics layer for rendering tokens
   - Added `borderPulsePhase` for border animation
   - Modified `drawField()` to show yellow pulsing border during global wraparound
   - Updated layer ordering: Field (border) → Curves → Tokens → Debug

6. **src/main.js**
   - Added import for `KurveTokenmanager.js`

## How It Works

1. **Spawning**: TokenManager spawns tokens at random intervals and positions
2. **Collision Detection**: Each frame, TokenManager checks if any curve head is touching a token
3. **Effect Application**: When collected, the appropriate effect is applied to the curve
4. **Duration Management**: Effects use setTimeout to automatically expire after 5-10 seconds
5. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Player wraparound: Position wraps to opposite side seamlessly, trail breaks and continues on opposite side
   - Global wraparound: Border color changes to yellow and pulses

## Wraparound Implementation Details

When a player crosses a wall with wraparound enabled:
1. The player's position is teleported to the opposite side
2. A `justWrapped` flag is set to prevent drawing a line across the screen
3. The next frame skips line drawing, creating a clean break in the trail
4. The trail continues from the new position on the opposite side

## Testing

The implementation has been successfully built and is ready for testing:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add visual blinking effect for player head during wraparound
- Add sound effects for token collection
- Add particle effects when tokens are collected
- Add more token types
- Make token spawn types configurable in game menu
