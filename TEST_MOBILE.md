# Quick Mobile Control Test

## Issue Diagnosis

If you're getting a 404 error for `/mobile-controller`, here's how to verify the setup:

### 1. Check File Exists
```bash
cd /Users/Perovrohliku/Developero/kurve
ls -la mobile-controller.html
```
Should show: `-rw-r--r--@ ... mobile-controller.html`

### 2. Check Dev Server is Running
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5173/mobile-controller.html
```
Should return: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

### 3. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/mobile-controller.html?peer=test`

You should see:
- Full-screen controller interface
- "Error: No peer ID provided in URL" OR "Connecting to game..." message
- Two large buttons (LEFT and RIGHT)

### 4. Check the Generated URL

1. Open the game: `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for: `Mobile controller URL: http://localhost:XXXX/mobile-controller.html?peer=xxxxx`
4. Copy that exact URL
5. Test it in a new tab - should work!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "404 Not Found" for /mobile-controller
**Cause**: Missing `.html` extension
**Solution**: The correct URL is `/mobile-controller.html` (with .html)

The generated URLs now include the full `.html` extension automatically.

### Issue: Different Port Number
**Cause**: Vite might start on a different port if 5173 is busy
**Solution**: 
- Check the console output when starting `npm run dev`
- Look for: `Local: http://localhost:XXXX/`
- Use that port number

### Issue: "localhost" doesn't work on mobile
**Cause**: `localhost` only works on the same device
**Solution**: 
1. Start server with: `npm run dev -- --host`
2. Find your computer's local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
3. Use: `http://192.168.1.100:5173/mobile-controller.html?peer=xxx`

### Issue: URL works in desktop but not mobile
**Cause**: Devices on different networks or firewall blocking
**Solution**:
- Ensure both devices on same WiFi
- Disable firewall temporarily
- Try different network

## Manual Testing Steps

### Desktop Test (No Mobile Needed)

1. Start the game:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser

3. You should see:
   - QR code in the menu
   - "Open Mobile Controller" link below QR code
   - "Copy URL" button
   - "0 controllers connected" status

4. Click "Open Mobile Controller" link
   - New tab should open with controller interface
   - Shows "Connecting..." then "Connected!"
   - Player assignment displays (e.g., "Playing as: Red")
   - Menu shows "1 controller connected"

5. Click LEFT and RIGHT buttons
   - Buttons should highlight
   - Console shows input events

### Mobile Test

1. Ensure dev server started with `--host`:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

2. Note the network URL from console output

3. On mobile:
   - **Option A**: Scan the QR code
   - **Option B**: Click the link sent from desktop
   - **Option C**: Type the URL manually

4. Mobile should show:
   - Connection confirmation
   - Player color assignment
   - Touch controls

## Current Implementation Status

✅ Files created and integrated
✅ Mobile controller page exists and is accessible
✅ Vite config updated for multi-page support
✅ QR code generation working
✅ Direct URL link provided
✅ Copy URL button added
✅ Connection status tracking
✅ Input handling implemented

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check if mobile-controller.html exists
ls -la mobile-controller.html

# Test accessibility
curl http://localhost:5173/mobile-controller.html

# Check Vite is running
ps aux | grep vite

# View generated URL in browser console
# Open http://localhost:5173/ and check console for:
# "Mobile controller URL: ..."
```

## Next Steps

If you're still seeing 404:
1. Share the exact URL you're trying to access
2. Share the URL shown in browser console
3. Check if the issue is:
   - Missing .html extension
   - Wrong port number
   - Mobile vs desktop testing
   - Network connectivity

The implementation is complete and the mobile controller page IS accessible. The issue is likely one of the common problems listed above.
